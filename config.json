    "description": "Provides some enhancements to REDCap's Data Resolution Workflow functionality, namely: <ul><li>Adds a button to data entry forms that will do the \"verified value\" step for all fields not yet verified or queried.</li><li>CSV exports have all data in separate columns (rather than combining, for example, username and comments).</li><li>Queries can be assigned to any user that may access the DAG (i.e. using DAG Switcher).</li></ul>",
