# REDCap External Module: DRW Tweaks

Provides some enhancements to REDCap's Data Resolution Workflow functionality, namely:
* Adds a button to data entry forms that will do the "verified value" step for all fields not yet verified or queried.
* CSV exports have all data in separate columns (rather than combining, for example, username and comments).
